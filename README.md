Using OpenCV on iPhone
----------------------
This source repository includes pre-compiled OpenCV library and headeres so that you can get started easily!
More documents you can see on [this article](http://niw.at/articles/2009/03/14/using-opencv-on-iphone/).

Building Static Link Version of OpenCV
--------------------------------------
If you want to build it from source code, you can do by next steps.

1.  Building OpenCV requiers [CMake](http://www.cmake.org/).
    You can easily install it by using [Homebrew](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/) or [MacPorts](http://www.macports.org/).

        # Using Homebrew
        % brew install cmake
        # Using MacPorts
        % sudo port install cmake

2.  Clone this project from github.com, then move into the project directory

        % git clone git://github.com/niw/iphone_opencv_test.git

3.  Getting source code from sourceforge. I tested with [OpenCV-2.2.0.tar.bz2](http://sourceforge.net/projects/opencvlibrary/files/opencv-unix/2.2/OpenCV-2.2.0.tar.bz2/download).

4.  Extract downloaded archive on the top of demo project directory

        % tar xjvf OpenCV-2.2.0.tar.bz2

5.  Apply patch for iPhone SDK

        % cd OpenCV-2.2.0
        % patch -p1 < ../OpenCV-2.2.0.patch

6.  Following next steps to build OpenCV static library for simulator.
    All files are installed into ``opencv_simulator`` directory.
    When running ``make`` command, you've better assign ``-j`` option and number according to number of your CPU cores.
    Without ``-j`` option, it takes a long time.

        % cd ..
        % mkdir build_simulator
        % cd build_simulator
        % ../opencv_cmake.sh Simulator ../OpenCV-2.2.0
        % make -j 4
        % make install

7.  Following next steps to build OpenCV static library for device
    All files are installed into ``opencv_device`` directory.

        % cd ..
        % mkdir build_device
        % cd build_device
        % ../opencv_cmake.sh Device ../OpenCV-2.2.0
        % make -j 4
        % make install

Build support script
--------------------

uild support script ``opencv_cmake.sh`` has some options to build OpenCV with iOS SDK.
Try ``--help`` option to get the all options of it.
